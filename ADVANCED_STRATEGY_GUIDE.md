# Advanced Chess Bot Strategy Implementation

## Overview

This enhanced chess bot implements sophisticated defensive and aggressive strategies that automatically adapt to opponent strength. The bot is designed to frustrate stronger opponents while applying maximum pressure to weaker ones, all while maintaining human-like timing patterns.

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Strategy Detection

- **Automatic Opponent Analysis**: Analyzes opponent's time usage patterns to classify strength
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Switches strategies mid-game based on opponent behavior
- **Smart Classification**:
  - Strong opponents (>70% time usage): Defensive/Stall tactics
  - Weak opponents (<30% time usage): Aggressive/Pressure tactics
  - Equal opponents: Balanced approach

### 2. Defensive Fortress Strategy

Perfect for frustrating stronger opponents and forcing them into time pressure:

**Position Selection Criteria:**

- Maintains material balance (+100 priority points)
- Creates complex positions with many legal moves (+2 per move)
- Avoids simplifications that reduce complexity (+50 bonus)
- Keeps maximum pieces on board (+3 per piece)
- Prefers complex checks over simple tactical shots

**Timing Strategy:**

- Uses 2.0-4.5x normal thinking time
- Adds 1.0-3.0 second "frustration delays"
- Forces opponents to wait for slow, methodical play
- Creates psychological pressure through deliberate pacing

### 3. Pressure Blitz Strategy

Designed to overwhelm weaker opponents with rapid tactical pressure:

**Move Selection Criteria:**

- Prioritizes captures and material gain (+150 points)
- Seeks checks and direct attacks (+100 for checks)
- Attacks undefended opponent pieces (+20 per target)
- Limits opponent's legal moves (+30 for restrictions)

**Timing Strategy:**

- Uses 0.4-0.8x normal timing for rapid execution
- No deliberate delays or stalling
- Quick tactical execution to maintain pressure
- Forces rapid decisions leading to mistakes

### 4. Human-Like Movement Transitions

**Position Complexity Analysis:**

```python
# Evaluation factors:
- Unclear positions (eval Â±50): Maximum complexity
- Many legal moves (>30): Additional thinking time
- Tactical positions: Reduced complexity
- Endgame positions: Moderate complexity
```

**Realistic Timing Patterns:**

- Simple captures/pawn moves: 0.3-1.2 seconds
- Complex positional decisions: 0.8-2.5 seconds
- Critical moments: Up to 4.5 seconds with stall factor
- Human inconsistency: 0.7-1.4x random variation

### 5. Strategic Time Management

**Safety Mechanisms:**

- Never uses more than 8% of remaining time per move
- Automatic emergency mode when <15% time remaining
- Intelligent time allocation throughout game

**Strategic Allocation:**

- Early game: Conservative time usage
- Middle game: Maximum strategic delays based on opponent
- Endgame: Calculated precision timing
- Time pressure: Rapid execution to avoid flagging

## Implementation Details

### Position Evaluation Function

```python
def evaluate_position_complexity(engine):
    # Analyzes evaluation score, legal moves, and position type
    # Returns complexity factor (0.3-1.0) for timing calculations
```

### Strategy Selection Functions

```python
def get_defensive_move(engine, top_moves):
    # Selects most defensive/frustrating move from candidates
    # Prioritizes complexity and piece retention

def get_aggressive_move(engine, top_moves):
    # Selects most aggressive/pressure move from candidates  
    # Prioritizes tactics and opponent restrictions
```

### Human-Like Delay Calculation

```python
def get_human_like_delay(stockfish_time, complexity, strategy):
    # Calculates realistic human timing based on:
    # - Position complexity
    # - Move type (capture, positional, etc.)
    # - Strategic factors (stall vs pressure)
    # - Time pressure considerations
    # - Human inconsistency patterns
```

## Strategic Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Against Chess Master (2400+)

```
Detection: Slow, methodical moves with high time usage
Strategy: Maximum Defensive Fortress
Execution:
- Complex, unclear positions
- Maximum stall tactics (2-4.5x delays)
- Material balance maintenance
- Psychological time pressure
Result: Forces master into time trouble on complex positions
```

### Scenario 2: Against Beginner (1200-)

```
Detection: Fast, careless moves with low time usage
Strategy: Aggressive Pressure Blitz
Execution:
- Rapid tactical strikes
- Minimal thinking delays (0.4-0.8x)
- Direct attacks and captures
- Continuous pressure maintenance
Result: Overwhelms beginner with tactical complexity
```

### Scenario 3: Against Equal Player (1800-2000)

```
Detection: Balanced time usage patterns
Strategy: Adaptive Balanced Approach
Execution:
- Moderate defensive bias
- Human-like timing variations
- Strategic complexity without extremes
- Responsive adaptation to opponent changes
Result: Flexible gameplay that adapts to opponent's style
```

## Anti-Detection Features

**Human-Like Characteristics:**

- Variable timing based on position complexity
- Realistic delays for different move types
- Inconsistent patterns that avoid robotic behavior
- Natural reactions to opponent's timing
- Strategic thinking time that makes contextual sense

**Behavioral Patterns:**

- Faster moves for simple tactics
- Longer delays for complex positions
- Time pressure responses
- Gradual timing adjustments (not sudden changes)
- Consistent but not predictable timing

## Configuration and Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with enhanced strategy
./advanced_strategy_config.sh
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
python main.py \
  --elo-rating -1 \
  --game-timer-ms 180000 \
  --first-move-w e2e4 \
  --enable-move-delay True \
  --next-game-auto True
```

### Monitoring Strategy

Watch the logs for real-time strategy information:

- `"Detected opponent strength: [weak/equal/strong]"`
- `"Using [defensive/aggressive] strategy"`
- `"Move delay: X.XXs (complexity: X.XX, strategy: XXX)"`
