Use case:

1. Copy the Stockfish binaries to the "$project_path"/stockfish/ directory
2. If the Stockfish executable name is not equal to "stockfish" (e.g. stockfish15.exe), the binary should be renamed, by also excluding the file extension.
3. Install required packages (it is recommended to use a python ```venv```):
    > pip install -r "requirements.txt"
4. In order to start the application:
    > python main.py
   
5. Enjoy the game
